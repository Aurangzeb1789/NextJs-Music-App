<h1>Music Mentor</h1>
<p>I recently developed a music course website as a personal project to showcase my skills in Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript. This dummy project highlights my ability to create a modern, responsive UI using these technologies. </p>
<h2> Key Technologies</h2>
--> Next.js : For server-side rendering and optimized performance </br>
--> Tailwind CSS : For utility-first, responsive design </br>
--> Aceternity : For elegant UI components </br>
--> TypeScript : For type safety and maintainable code </br>
<h2>Live Demo </h2>
Check out the live deployment of the project on Vercel: https://next-js-music-app-dw7i.vercel.app/
